    "snippet": "I had a great experience at Pinnacle Group of Tutions, they give personal attention to each of the students and the teachers teach the topics in very detail which helped me greatly in my board and entrance exams. Their weekly tests in the same pattern as the entrance exams gave me a very good assessment which ultimately gave me a major boost in my MHT CET Result. It is a great choice as classes for students.",
